# Ava_mobileServer
An Express server application with Android client that can scan your medical prescriptions and keep track of it to remind you to take them and also send text notifications to your emergency contacts in case of medical emergencies.

The Ava mobile client is a private repository that my other partners worked on. I built the server for the patients who will be using the mobile app.
